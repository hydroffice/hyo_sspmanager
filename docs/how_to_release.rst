How to release
==============

Versioning
----------

You might want to install ``bumpversion``, so that you can run something like:

* ``bumpversion --allow-dirty --new-version 0.2.5 patch``.

The above version value must agree with the variables ``version`` and ``release`` present in the ``conf.py`` under the `docs` folder.
